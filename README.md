# PE02 – CoreComponents

## Input
- The user can enter their favorite MSCS course using a TextInput component.
- Course information will display on the screen 
 (Core, Depth, and Capstone courses) which is loaded from JSON data

## Process
- The app uses a functional component with `useState` to manage user input.
- `ScrollView` ensures the app is scrollable.
- React Native core components (`View`, `Text`, `Image`, `TextInput`, `StyleSheet`) are used to construct and style the UI.

### Core React Native components:

- ScrollView - Makes content scrollable

- View - Container for layout

- Text - Displays course information

- TextInput - Captures user's favorite course

- Image - Shows the university logo

- StyleSheet - Handles component styling

## Output
- Displays user’s favorite course below the input field.
- Displays CityU MSCS core courses.
- Also shows depth of study and capstone course.
